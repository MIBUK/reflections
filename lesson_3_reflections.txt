When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to share a project with several people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because there might be changes that could break/change your code.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are to make a copy of someone elses repository to your Github account, while still acknowledging that the source was from the original owner. 
Clones are are to make a copy of a repository to your local computer
Branches are what you create either a master or a master with other branches for testing new concepts etc.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So you have a ynced/latest copy on both the remote and local.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Email or other sharing services like Dropbox. It would be easier if you have no knowledge of how GitHub works, but it would be difficult to track changes from yourself and especially from other collaborators.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
So you test new code before implementing it into the main code. Allow other people to see it, change it, test it to confirm that it works or maybe make improvements.
